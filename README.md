# üëã HEYY GUYS!
So I added a prototype of the app to the main view so you can see more or less the communication between pages. Now we have a functioning Single Page Application! üéÜ üçæ I kept it suuuper simple, so first filling a form (name), second picking a template and then the final view. There is a lot to do and as I have done quite a lot today and yesterday I will leave the project for you so you can practice and I will rejoin next week. Things to do:

1. Have a look at the counter component to see how redux is implemented.
The first page - form. Add CV fields to the form without the logic for now. Add a CSS so the form looks nice. Create a separate CSS file for the main form.

2. Once the form looks good add the logic to the form so we save the details into REDUX store.
The second page - pick a template. Instead of adding a simple background color how about using a background image? Or use any ideas you might have about the CV template and add it to the CSS instead of the color. Move the CSS to a separate file. Use canva.com for CV template inspiration.

3. The third page: final view! Grab all the details from the redux store form info and display it and add the styling that got pick in a previous step.

Development branch has been rename main. To update your local clone follow these steps:

1. git branch -m development main
2. git fetch origin
3. git branch -u origin/main main
4. git remote set-head origin -a

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
